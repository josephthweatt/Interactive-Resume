I am a Software Engineer who has recently graduated Computer Science at Arizona State University. 

While in school, I have completed two summer internships, worked as a CS tutor, and co-founded ASU's first mobile development club. 
I am now employed fulltime at Connexta, located in Burlington Massachusetts.

When I'm not working, I can be found learning new programming skills, reading, writing, and working on small projects with my friends.
