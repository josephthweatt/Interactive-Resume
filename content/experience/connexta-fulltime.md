After graduation, I decided to work with Connexta full-time. As a software engineer, I am helping to redesign the architecture
of several of our existing products to function as cloud-based platforms. My current stack involves working with AWS, 
Kubernetes, Apache NiFi and Java.

See my Github page for contributions to Connexta's repositories.
